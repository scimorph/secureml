**Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Made Simple**

SecureML is a Python library that enables machine learning engineers to build and deploy models while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA. 

The library provides tools for:

* **Data Anonymization**: K-anonymity, pseudonymization, and data masking
* **Privacy-Preserving Training**: Differential privacy and federated learning
* **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create realistic but private datasets
* **Compliance Checking**: Automated compliance verification
* **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for documentation
