# SecureML Tests

This directory contains comprehensive test suites for the SecureML library. The tests are designed to ensure that all components of the library work as expected and maintain compatibility as the project evolves.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized by module, with each module having its own test file:

- `test_anonymization.py`: Tests for the anonymization module (k-anonymity, l-diversity, etc.)
- `test_privacy.py`: Tests for the privacy module (differential privacy, etc.)
- `test_compliance.py`: Tests for the compliance module (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA checks)
- `test_audit.py`: Tests for the audit logging and tracking module
- `test_synthetic.py`: Tests for the synthetic data generation module
- `test_federated.py`: Tests for the federated learning module
- `test_reporting.py`: Tests for the report generation module
- `test_cli.py`: Tests for the command-line interface

## Testing Approach

The test suite employs the following strategies:

1. **Unit Testing**: Each function and class is tested in isolation to ensure it works correctly.
2. **Mock Objects**: External dependencies and complex components are mocked to focus on the specific unit under test.
3. **Parametrization**: Tests use parametrization to cover multiple scenarios and edge cases.
4. **Fixtures**: Common test setups are created as fixtures to promote code reuse.
5. **Integration Testing**: Critical workflows are tested end-to-end to ensure components work together.

## Test Framework

The tests are implemented using:

- **pytest**: The primary test framework
- **unittest**: Used for certain test cases that benefit from the unittest.TestCase class
- **unittest.mock**: For mocking external dependencies
- **tempfile**: For creating temporary test files and directories

## Running the Tests

To run the entire test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

To run tests for a specific module:

```bash
pytest test_anonymization.py
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
pytest test_anonymization.py::TestAnonymization::test_k_anonymize
```

To run tests with coverage information:

```bash
pytest --cov=secureml
```

## Test Configurations

The test suite uses the following configuration:

- Test fixtures are defined in each test file
- Mocks are used to simulate the behavior of components not directly under test
- Temporary files and directories are used for testing I/O operations
- Random seeds are set for reproducibility when using random data

## Contributing New Tests

When adding new functionality to SecureML, please also add corresponding tests. Follow these guidelines:

1. Create tests for both the happy path and error cases
2. Use parametrized tests to cover multiple scenarios
3. Use mocking for external dependencies
4. Follow the existing naming patterns
5. Add appropriate docstrings to test functions
6. Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on external state

## Continuous Integration

These tests are automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline for SecureML. All tests must pass before changes are merged into the main codebase.

## Test Documentation

Each test file includes detailed docstrings explaining:

- The purpose of each test
- What functionality is being tested
- Expected behavior and outcomes
- Any special setup or configuration required

This documentation helps other developers understand what's being tested and why, making it easier to maintain and extend the test suite as the project evolves.
